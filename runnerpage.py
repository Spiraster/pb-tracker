# runnerpage.py
# Author: Richard Gibson
#
# Renders individual runner pages at /runner/<username_code>, where 
# username_code is the runner's username converted to lower case with most 
# non-alphanumeric characters replaced with dashes (see util.get_code).  
#
# There are two versions of runner pages.  The default version renders a 
# table of PBs submitted by the runner, ordered by number of runs.  
# The content of this table is aquired through handler.get_pblist() that 
# returns a list of dictionaries, one for each game.  For each dictionary d, 
# d['infolist'] is itself another list of dictionaries, one for each category 
# the runner has run for the given game.  These dictionaries are acquired 
# through handler.get_runinfo(). The alternative runner page is rendered 
# given the query string '?q=view-all' and lists all of the runner's runs, 
# ordered by run date, acquired through handler.get_runlist_for_runner().  
# This function returns its own list of dictionaries.
